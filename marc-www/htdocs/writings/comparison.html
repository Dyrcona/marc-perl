Here's a first cut (from memory, etc) on differences.

MARC.pm is not being heavily developed.
Most future effort is likely to be devoted to
MARC::Record and friends.

MARC::Record, ::Field are somewhat comparable to
MARC.pm in functionality. MARC::Lint is a useful
and elegant module with no MARC.pm equivalent.

There is a fair amount of documentation for MARC.pm
both in POD and in the archives of perl4lib.
As yet, MARC::Record and friends have not accreted
a similar quantity of docs. On the other hand, MARC::Record
has fewer opportunities to be confusing, so will
probably need less docs.

MARC.pm has a large (disorganized) regression test
suite. MARC::Record has not yet accreted an equally
large suite.


MARC.pm is oriented to files of MARC records. Its
core data structure is an array with first element
administrative information and then MARC::Recs, which
encode the details of each MARC record. It has methods
to stream parsing and output of MARC records, but
is oriented to parsing and generating entire files
full of MARC records.

MARC::Record is oriented to individual MARC records.

MARC.pm supports several common on-disk formats for
MARC records (marcbreaker, binary MARC transmission format,
simple string-oriented encoding..).

MARC::Record currently supports (I can only remember
binary MARC transmission, what is the real story Andy??)
fewer formats.

MARC.pm has methods to pack and unpack leader and 008
information in a bib-format sensitive manner (books vs
serials, e.g.).

MARC.pm has core support for a tie module (not yet
distributed: mea culpa) that allows for additions/deletions
to the first instance of, e.g. 245 subfield b references.

MARC.pm has two entire suites of methods for deleting
and inserting fields and subfields; one oriented
to maintaining existing field order and the other not.

MARC.pm has an integrated index into a MARC record
that reflects it quite well into Perl data structures
(good mostly for read-only uses, but can be sometimes
used for updates). So for example if $m is a
MARC instance and $r=$m->[1] is a MARC::Rec
then $r->{'245'}{'a'}[0] would refer to the title
string.

MARC.pm uses 'templates' {field=>245, subfield=>a}
pervasively; it is worthwhile to see how they are used
to take full advantage of it.

MARC::Record (and ::Field) uses methods consistently.

MARC.pm has a bunch of methods that make sense only
for files of records (searching, deleting, etc).

MARC::Record can easily be used for files of records;
equivalents for MARC.pm's file-oriented methods
can easily (and in my opinion more flexibly) be created
out of Perl's core array support.

MARC.pm does not mind you understanding and using its
internal structures. (Although updating its index
using anything other than its internal method is er
likely to yield suprises.)

MARC::Record is oriented to the classic method-only
access.

MARC.pm is a one-file install. In consequence
(and in consequence of its file orientation)
subclassing MARC.pm is less likely to be successful
than subclassing MARC::Record. But you don't have to
keep track of a potentially exploding set of classes
in many cases.

&lt;rant&gt;
Personal opinion only.
MARC::Record (or some subclass) should probably grow
support for header/008/(007?) packing and unpacking.

The current MARC.pm support for binary formats should
be transplanted into a MARC::Record (or a subclass,
or use Perl's multiple inheritance to make a mixin).

MARC.pm's index should *not* make it into MARC::Record,
or at least be implemented in a subclass and advertised
as a read-only optional convenience.

MARC.pm's templates are iffy. It is not clear that
they are clearer than methods with parameters. They
may muddy the waters.

MARC.pm's support for file oriented processing
should be *not* be transported to MARC::Record.
Common Perl idioms applied to a MARC::Records are
more understandable, more flexible and easier to
explain than MARC's custom methods.

There is a bunch of administrative information
in MARC.pm that should at least be considered
for MARC::Record.

Core support for ties to hashes could be added to
a MARC::Record subclass. The port should be
pretty straight-forward. This is a good way to
see whether the MARC::Record abstractions are
robust enough to support serious editing.

I disagree with LOC. Field order *does* belong
in any MARC-oriented software library. MARC::Record
should advertise and support methods that maintain
it on edits where possible.
&lt;/rant&gt;
