<h1>MARC and Perl</h1>

<hr>

</div>

<h2>General considerations</h2>

<p>MARC and Perl are a natural pair. Perl
has strong text-processing capabilities: the 
canonical Marc standard format mostly encodes 
text. Not surprisingly, many individuals and groups have 
used Perl to manipulate MARC records. Some have published
their scripts or modules for others to use.
</p>
<p>
Here we concentrate on five implementations
defined at the library level. 
We will comment on the implied structure of the modules, their
robustness, installation difficulty, level of detail, current support
and capability for data conversion.

<p>
In rough chronological order, we have:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>LOC's sgml-marc effort.
<li>Knight's MARC::Metadata
<li>Steve's Marc::Base
<li>BBLMS's MARC.pm and Summer's MARC::XML
<li>Andy's MARC::Record,::Lint,::Field
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Perl modules we consider are freely available and
modifiable. They are all likely to work correctly on
most inputs and generate correct outputs in most cases.
</p>

<p>
Knights, Steves and BBLMS' have an essentially one-file
install using standard perl techniques. BBLMS provides extra support
for Windows: it handles the common case where nmake is
not installed.

Sgml-marc requires freely available third-party utilities and 
currently some sophistication to use. 
</p>

<p>
We will define some terms for clarity:
<ul>
<li>
"MARC" records are in the binary file format defined for
transmission of bibliographic information. Many MARC records are typically
concatenated in a file, typically separated by
a unique binary separator.
</li>

<li>
"MARC-like" records like mkrbrkr and the various
XML versions are commonly used for internal 
purposes. They are numerous and pervasive in the 
library world, as are MARC records.
</li>

<li>
Control fields are ones with tags in the range
001-009, with subfields often positionally defined.
</li>

<li>
Leaders are the fixed-length preamble of MARC
records defining structural information (position and
length of fields, etc) and some information of bibliographic
interest (enough to define format in the sense of BOOKS vs SERIALS).
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
BBLMS supports data conversion between MARC-like records
extensively, and Knight's for a small set.

Other modules have suitable data structures defined
that can form the basis of conversion. LOC's requires
a little work to uncover, and Steve's is obvious.
Andy does not want to expose his data representation,
but the current version can support MARC-Like records.
</p>
<p>
Steve's module is the only one to trade off
readability against the (very rare) possibility of corruption
from unexpected data in subfields. All others 
leave subfield separators in native binary form (they are
illegal characters in any other position) or parse subfields
into Perl data structures.
</p>
<p>
Parsing of leaders is done by all except
Steve's and Andy's modules. LOC parses all control fields, and 
BBLMS the 008 field. Andy, Knight and Steve leave control fields
as is.
</p>

<h2>The Library of Congress's approach to SGML</h2>

<p>

LOC launched a typically thorough effort
to provide for <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/marcsgml.html">
SGML-MARC conversion</a>.

Only institutions of the scale of 
LOC can hope to quickly change the de-facto
importance of various features supported by the MARC
format. 

LOC gathered together
many MARC and SGML authorities, who declared that the order
of tags in a MARC record was not important. 
This declaration goes against current practice in at least one 
institution. It has a fighting chance 
of becoming a new de-facto desideratum
for MARC-processing techniques. In fact
only Andy's, Steve's and BBLMS' implementations 
support order preservation. (BBLMS actually
defaults to ignoring order of fields during editing;
you have to look around a bit to find the methods that preserve
order during editing).

LOC's implementation honours
positional semantics for the traditional
control fields, without specifying a 
canonical name for the positionally 
defined subfields. 

</p>

<p>

sgml-marc uses some tables in sgml (nearly xml)
format that define character-entity maps, parsing
of positionally defined fields, and basic marc format.

sgml-marc defines two perl utilities, mrc2sgm and
sgm2mrc that convert back and forth between standard
MARC records and a LOC-defined sgml equivalent.

mrc2sgm handles large files record-by-record,
which is necessary when the files have
32,000 records. It carefully checks many features
of the records as it processes, and is driven by
externally defined tables that have been mechanically
derived from MARC specifications. mrc2sgm knows
about every positionally defined control field,
and MARC's leader information. The output is
probably xml-compliant, and hence has access to
the many implementations of XML standards (XPath,
XSLT,XHTML). 

The clear intent for LOC's effort is that 
standard MARC records are mapped to an adequate
(X/SG)ML file, which is then handled by (X/SG)ML
technologies, which are available for all major
languages and environments. LOC's software does not deal with 
MARC-like records natively but adding this
capability is possible.

</p>

<p>

LOC uses Perl data structures implicitly during its
transformations. The best data structures to use
for creating/reading MARC-like records look like:

<pre>

Leader:00901cam  2200241Ia 45e0
$VAR1 = {
    100 =&gt; ['1 aTwain, Mark,d1835-1910.'],
    '001' =&gt; ['ocm01047729 '],
    300 =&gt; ['  axvi, 438 p., [1] leaf of plates :bill. ;c20 cm.'],
    '003' =&gt; ['OCoLC'],
    '040' =&gt; ['  aKSUcKSUdGZM'],
    500 =&gt; [
             '  aFirst English ed.',
             '  aState B; gatherings saddle-stitched with wire staples.',
             '  hAdvertisements on p. [1]-32 at end.',
             '  aBound in red S cloth; stamped in black and gold.'
           ],
    '005' =&gt; ['19990808143752.0'],
    994 =&gt; ['  aE0bVOD'],
    510 =&gt; ['4 aBALc3414.'],
    '008' =&gt; ['741021s1884    enkaf         000 1 eng d'],
....
}

</pre>

i.e the unparsed leader and a separate data structure
providing for a list of fields (represented as strings with
including unparsed indicators) per tag.

The file-oriented output is LOC's intended core
structure and looks like:

<pre>

&lt;/mrcb100&gt;
&lt;/mrcb-main-entry&gt;

&lt;/mrcb&gt;

</pre>

<p>

sgm2mrc requires external utilities to handle
SGML (as is typical in all XML/SGML scenarios).
These utilities are not heavily supported in 
the Perl community (unlike XML::Parser/Expat
which is installed by default in ActiveState's
Windows version and is the common substrate for
essentially all XML modules in Perl).

I needed to change some file name cases to make sgm2mrc
work under Linux and spent quite a bit of time 
getting the sgml utilities working. The output of
sgm2mrc shows some extra return characters under
Linux: there appears to be some DOS assumptions in 
the package. 

mrc2sgm encodes essentially all items of independent interest
in a marc record. It takes care of format dependencies but
does not attempt to do more. The associated DTD's provide
validation for a very large subset of traditional MARC
requirements.

LOC's ftp site has dates 1996, 1998 and Nov 26 2000, but its latest
distribution required some attention to compile under
*nix at the time of writing (October 2001).

<h2>Jon Knight's Metadata::Marc</h2>

<p>
Jon Knight's <a href="ftp://ftp.roads.lut.ac.uk/pub/ROADS/contrib/">
Metadata::Marc</a> can read and write USMARC, UNIMARC, and a local 
variant, BCLMPMARC.  It is 
documented in two articles:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue7/marc/">Handling MARC with Perl</a>
<li><a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue8/marc/">Making MARC with Dublin Core</a>
</ul>
</p>

<P>

A Metadata file reader includes code like this:

<PRE>
open F, $ARGV[0] or die "Could not open $ARGV[0] for read:$!\n";
ReadMarcRecord(*F);
print Dumper($MarcRecord);
# At this stage, you have read the first record
 
print Dumper($MarcRecord)

$VAR1 = {
  'level' => {
    '001' => ['0'],
    100 => ['0'],
    '003' => ['0'],
    300 => ['0'],
    '040' => ['0'],
    '005' => ['0'],
    500 => [0,0,0,0],
    510 => ['0'],
....
  },
  'data' => {
    '001' => ['ocm01047729 '],
    100 => ['1 aTwain, Mark,d1835-1910.'],
    '003' => ['OCoLC'],
    300 => ['  axvi, 438 p., [1] leaf of plates :bill. ;c20 cm.'],
....
    500 => [
      '  aFirst English ed.',
      '  aState B; gatherings saddle-stitched with wire staples.',
      '  hAdvertisements on p. [1]-32 at end.',
      '  aBound in red S cloth; stamped in black and gold.'
    ],
....
    245 => [ '14aThe adventures of Huckleberry Finn :b(Tom Sawyer\'s comrade)
: scene, the Mississippi Valley : time, forty to fifty years ago /hby Mark
Twain (Samuel Clemens) ; with 174 illustrations.'
    ],
  },
  'type' => 'a',
  'typecntl' => ' ',
  'linked_rec_require' => ' ',
  'descriptive_cat_form' => 'a',
  'status' => 'c',
  'marc_type' => 'USMARC',
  'encoding_level' => 'I'
};

</PRE>

</P>

<P>

This will also handle marc_type of UNIMARC (a global standard) as well
as USMARC and a local BCLMPMARC which uses the 'level' key. (Each
field in BCLMPMARC has a tag used to describe field-level status.)

I had to change $BaseAddress to 'local' from 'my' to compile the
module.
My copy of Metadata::Marc has some changes in subroutine signatures
also, although they are not strictly necessary.

The latest version is dated Aug 11 1999 at the time of writing.

Note that the data structure leaves subfield separators alone,
parses leader information, and does not keep track of tag order.
In fact, the WriteMarc method writes them out in numeric tag order.

You find out that you are at the end of a marc file by noticing
$MarcRecord->{marc_type} eq 'Invalid'.

</P>

<H2>Stephen Thomas's Modules</H2>

<P>

Stephen Thomas 
<a href='http://www.library.adelaide.edu.au/~sthomas/scripts/'>has modules</a>
that understand (US)MARC records.
</P>

<p>

A typical extract from a file reader is:
</p>
<PRE>

local $/ = $REC_SEP;
open F, $ARGV[0] or die "Could not open $ARGV[0] for read:$!\n";
my $marcrecord = <F>;
my @marc_array = &marc2array ($marcrecord);
print Dumper(\@marc_array);
</PRE>
And the dump of the first record looks like
<PRE>
          'LDR 00901cam  2200241Ia 45e0',
          '001 ocm01047729 ',
          '003 OCoLC',
          '005 19990808143752.0',
          '008 741021s1884    enkaf         000 1 eng d',
          '040   |aKSU|cKSU|dGZM',
          '090   |aPS1305|b.A1 1884',
          '049   |aVODN',
          '100 1 |aTwain, Mark,|d1835-1910.',
          '245 14|aThe adventures of Huckleberry Finn :|b(Tom Sawyer\'s
comrade) : scene, the Mississippi Valley : time, forty to fifty years ago /|hby
Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) ; with 174 illustrations.',
          '260   |aLondon :|bChatto & Windus,|c1884.',
          '300   |axvi, 438 p., [1] leaf of plates :|bill. ;|c20 cm.',
          '500   |aFirst English ed.',
          '500   |aState B; gatherings saddle-stitched with wire staples.',
          '500   |hAdvertisements on p. [1]-32 at end.',
          '500   |aBound in red S cloth; stamped in black and gold.',
          '510 4 |aBAL|c3414.',
          '740 01|aHuckleberry Finn.',
          '994   |aE0|bVOD'

</PRE>

<P>

The data structure changes subfield separators to an unusual
human-readable form, leaves leader information unchanged, and keeps
track of tag order. 
</p>
<p>
End of file appears to be signalled by a @marc_arry with the single element:
'LDR '.
</p>
Incremental reading is available by native Perl methods; the
core function takes a single marc record and returns a 
parsed version.
<p>
I was able to use MARC::Base essentially out of the box.
The latest version of MARC::Base appears to be Mar 1999.

</P>

<H2>MARC.pm</H2>

<P>

Bearden,Birthisel,Lane,McFadden and Summers' <A HREF="http://marcpm.sourceforge.net">MARC.pm</A>has grown many features over time. We concentrate
on a few capabilities.
</p>
<p>
MARC.pm a basic "data+index" structure, overlaying an emphasis on 
groups of MARC records.
</p>
<p>
Consider an in-memory version of a usmarc file of marc records, $x. We
will examine it in perl's debugger.
<p>
$x is a reference to an array.
The zeroth element of the array is
used for housekeeping for the entire array.

<PRE>

DB<7> x keys %{$x->[0]}
0..4  'format' 'strict' 'handle' 'proto_rec' 'increment'
</PRE>
<ul>
<li>$x->[0]{format} is a string like 'usmarc' and controls
what kind of marc record is expected on input.
<li>
$x->[0]{handle} is the file-handle, used for incremental
access to potentially large files of MARC records.
<li>
$x->[0]{increment} tells MARC how many records to attempt
to read in at a time.
<li>
'strict' is related to level of error handling; 'proto_rec'
used to bridge between the file-of-record and record-oriented
views.
</ul>


The first and all later elements of the array are 
instances of MARC::Rec, in which resides all record-specific
behaviour.

<PRE>

  DB<6> x keys %{$x->[1]}
0..18  000 100 001 300 003 040 500 005 994 510 008 260 'format' 090 740 245
'handle' 049 'array'

</PRE>

You can see format and handle keys; these are inherited from the MARC
object (or can be set directly).

The primary data structure of a MARC::Rec is keyed off 'array'

<PRE>

  DB<8> x $x->[1]{array}

      0..4  500 ' ' ' ' 'a' 'Bound in red S cloth; stamped in black and gold.'
...

</PRE>

The array can support fields out of numeric order, (notice the 090 field
<b>before</b> the
049 field). Notice that indicators are treated differently from subfields,
and that fields are pre-parsed.

There are a variety of indexes into this structure.

         3  ARRAY(0x83d5de4)
            -> REUSED_ADDRESS

These can easily be used to answer interesting read-only information
on MARC records using native Perl idioms e.g.

<dl>

<dt>How many 500 fields are there?</dt>
<dd>scalar @{$x->[1]{500}{fields}}</dd>
<dt>
How many subfield a's exist in 500 fields?</dt>
<dd> scalar @{$x->[1]{500}{a}}</dd>
</dl>

etc.

</PRE>

<P>

Because these indexes use Perl references pervasively, it
is possible to update some subfields from the index, which
is a neat trick, but dangerous.  
</P>
<p>
It is possible to entirely avoid use of the index structure.
Native perl idioms applied to the
'array' fields are enough, with some MARC::Rec methods, to
do everything that I have ever needed MARC.pm for.
</P>
<p>
MARC.pm provides methods to change leader and 008 fields back and forth
between hashes and the basic fixed field format. The
hash version of the 008 field is keyed by unp_008:

<PRE>

  DB<11> $x->[1]->unpack_008
  DB<13> x $x->[1]{unp_008}
0  HASH(0x82ef670)
   'Audn' => ' ', 'Biog' => ' ', 'Conf' => 0, 'Cont' => '    ',
   'Ctry' => 'enk', 'Date1' => 1884, 'Date2' => '    ', 'DtSt' => 's',
   'Entered' => 741021, 'Fest' => 0, 'Fict' => 1, 'Form' => ' ',
   'GPub' => ' ', 'Ills' => 'af  ', 'Indx' => 0, 'Lang' => 'eng',
   'MRec' => ' ', 'Srce' => 'd', 'Undef1' => ' '

</PRE>

And there are similar methods for the leader.  You can regard this as
a halfway-house to LOC's full parsing and third party validation of
006,007, and 008 fields.
</P>

Finally, at present, MARC.pm handles bibliographic versions of
a variety of MARC formats. What needs to be done with authorities
and other defined kinds is not clear.
</P>
<p>
The latest version is dated Mar 2001.
</p>
<P>
MARC::XML illustrates an apparent difficulty related to MARC-Like
conversions. MARC.pm supports many MARC-Like formats natively,
but re-using these inside MARC::XML required some care. 
MARC::XML needed to define a different version of LOC's SGML
format because it chose to support out-of-order
tags.

<H2>MARC::Record</H2>

<P>

Andy Lester has three linked CPAN modules: <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/MARC/PETDANCE/">MARC::Record, MARC::Field and MARC::Lint.</A>
<p>
Andy de-emphasizes an explicit internal data structure in favor
of methods and an extra MARC::Field class. His methods for access
to fields and subfields of a MARC record are sufficiently detailed
to support MARC-Like records.
<p>
A related MARC::Lint class defines a useful format for 
checking indicators and repeatability for fields and subfields.
<p>
MARC::Record's desire to avoid explicit data structures
requires adding explicit support for editing MARC records
in memory. Defining an appropriate set of low-level
methods to support MARC record editing appears to be
difficult. MARC.pm probably has a superset of these methods,
but it unclear whether this is the right set.
<p>
MARC::Record does not currently parse leader and 008 information.
<p>
Installation worked out-of-the-box at time of writing.

The latest version is dated Sept 2001.
