<h1>Description</h1>

<p>MARC/Perl is a Perl 5 library for reading, manipulating, outputting and
converting bibliographic records in the <a
href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a> format. The <b>MA</b>chine
<b>R</b>eadable <b>C</b>ataloging format was designed by the Library of Congress
in the late 1960s in order to allow libraries to convert their card catalogs
into a digital format. The MARC format was standardized as <a
href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-2.pdf">ANSI/NISO Z39.2</a> 
in 1971 and is now being used by libraries around the world to provide 
computerized access to their collections.</p>

<p>It is common for corporate, public and academic libraries to purchase
Integrated Library Systems to organize and manage their collections. However, it
is often advantageous for libraries to be able to create or massage pre-existing
MARC data on the way into or out-of such systems. This is the niche that
MARC/Perl was designed to fill. If you can think of any other niches (ie. Open 
Source Software for libraries) please let us know!

<p>Development of this software library began with MARC.pm in the summer of
1999.  After much experimentation, enhancement and discussion the MARC::Record
framework was adopted which provides a more scalable approach to processing
MARC data with Perl. While you can still download and get the documentation 
for MARC.pm, it is recommended that new users download MARC::Record.
Future development of the MARC namespace on CPAN will fit into 
the framework provided by MARC::Record. If you have ideas for new modules 
please join the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/marcpm/">
development team</a>, or consider positing to the <a
href="http://www.rice.edu/perl4lib">perl4lib</a> list.</p>  

<p>If you have any feature requests, or find any bugs (gasp) please report 
them via <a href="mailto:bug-MARC-Record@rt.cpan.org">RT</a>, the CPAN 
request tracking system.</p>

<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>

The latest stable version of the MARC::Record package is available from 
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/MARC/">Comprehensive 
Perl Archive Network (CPAN)</a>. Experimental versions can often be found in 
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1254">
download area</a> here at Sourceforge. Although older versions of MARC.pm are 
available for download, we recommend you use the MARC::Record package since 
future development will use it as a foundation.

<h1>Web Interface</h1>

<p>If you want to try out the MARC/Perl library without actually installing you 
can test it out by uploading and retrieving records from a 
<a href="http://marcpm.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/converter.cgi">Web Interface</a>
to it. <i>Note:</i> this interface only provides a small glimpse of the 
full capabilities of this software To get the full funtionality you must 
download the MARC::Record library and install.</p>
