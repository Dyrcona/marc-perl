MARC/Perl is a set of Perl 5 libraries for reading, manipulating,
outputting and converting bibliographic records in the MARC format.
The MAchine Readable Cataloging format was designed by the Library
of Congress in the late 1960s in order to allow libraries to convert
their card catalogs into a digital format. The MARC format was
standardized as ANSI/NISO Z39.2 in 1971 and is now being used by
libraries around the world to provide computerized access to their
collections.

These are the separate projects that make up MARC/Perl:

    marc-record - core MARC processing library
    marc-lint - examine your MARC data for common problems
    marc-xml - extensions to marc-record for working with MARCXML
    marc-mij - extensions to marc-record for working with marc-in-json
    marc-marcmaker - extensions to marc-record to handle MARCMaker format
    marc-charset - work with MARC-8 and UTF-8 encodings
    marc-www - the sourceforge website
